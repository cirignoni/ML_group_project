# Machine Learning Course Assignments
(Nov 2021)

This repository contains two assignments that my team and I carried out in Polimi's Machine Learning course, one on classification (for identifying an e-commerce churners) and the other one on regression (to predict the popularity of reviews in a website). The goals of the two assignment were not interpretative but very much focused on the results, meaning that we were evaluated, respectively, only on the F1 and the MSE. With the code and the data, two docs come along to provide descriptions of the process to reach the final results.
